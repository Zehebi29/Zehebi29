# Hi, I'm Hangbin 👋

I work on **AI for digital twins and human-in-the-loop visual intelligence**, focusing on building data-efficient, explainable, and deployable CV/ML systems for **healthcare** and **industrial** scenarios.

## Research Snapshot

![Research roadmap](assets/images/research-roadmap.png)

My recent research centers on **visual modeling → multimodal reasoning → optimization** for digital-twin applications, especially under real-world constraints (limited labels, dynamic environments, and deployment latency).

- **Explainable visual perception with prior knowledge**
- **Neuro-symbolic / multimodal visual reasoning**
- **Human feedback–guided visual optimization**

## Experience & Education (brief)

I am currently a **Postdoctoral Researcher** at **The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)**. I earned my **Ph.D. (2025)** in *Intelligent Manufacturing & Robotics* from **Donghua University**, with a research focus on digital-twin visual modeling, multimodal reasoning, and human-in-the-loop optimization for healthcare and industrial applications.
